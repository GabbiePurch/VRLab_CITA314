# Struggles:

#My raycasts in gamemode would not work correctly so I had to go inot project settings -> XR Plugin Management -> OpenXR -> Interaction Profiles and turn on for both android and comnpater profiles the Meta Quest Touch Controllers both the Plus and Pro. My hands worked after this. I also properly connected my headset to unity by shutting my headset down and turning it back on and allowing the USB debugg link connection. 

#Another struggle was also getting to actually do this due to having two sugeries within a week and a half and needing to be in the lab at school to do them.
